### Overview
This project analyzes data related to belly button biodiversity of participants in a study. Using HTML and JavaScriptâ€™s Plotly and D3 libraries, I created a dashboard, searchable by participant, to display the top 10 bacterial cultures found in a participant's belly button, the frequency of each bacteria present, and the amount of time they washed their belly button weekly.
