## Overview
This project analyzes data related to belly button biodiversity. By using HTML and Javascript's Plotly and D3 libraries, I have created a dashboard to present the top 10 bateria cultures found in a participant's belly button, all of the bateria cultures found in their belly button, and their weekly washing freqency.
